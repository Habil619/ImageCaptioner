# AI-Powered Image Recognition and Captioning System

Welcome to the AI-Powered Image Recognition and Captioning System project! This project allows you to automatically recognize objects in images and generate descriptive captions for them using state-of-the-art deep learning models.


## Overview

In this project, we combine the power of Vision Transformers (ViT) for image feature extraction and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, such as GPT-2, for caption generation. The result is an AI system capable of analyzing images and providing descriptive textual captions, making it useful for a wide range of applications, from image description for visually impaired individuals to enriching media content with informative captions.

## Features

- **Image Recognition**: Automatically recognizes objects and features within uploaded images.
- **Caption Generation**: Generates descriptive captions for recognized images using NLP models.
- **User Interface**: Provides a user-friendly web interface for uploading and processing images.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6+
- Install the required packages using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install torch torchvision transformers
